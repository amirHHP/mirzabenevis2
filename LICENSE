**Summary:**
The MS-RSL is a **proprietary, source-available** license that **only permits read-only “reference use”** of the covered code, primarily for debugging or learning purposes, and **strictly forbids any redistribution or modification**—commercial or non-commercial. It was first applied when Microsoft released the .NET Framework 3.5 libraries’ source under MS-RSL in late 2007 and remains in use for some older Microsoft codebases. ([Wikipedia][1], [Wikipedia][2])

## 1. Background & Purpose

Microsoft’s **Shared Source Initiative** (SSI), launched in May 2001, offered five source-available licenses ranging from fully open (Ms-PL, Ms-RL) to highly restrictive. MS-RSL sits at the restrictive end, aimed at allowing developers to **inspect** Microsoft’s implementation while **preserving full control** over its use and distribution. ([Wikipedia][1])

## 2. Key Definitions

* **Reference use:** Use “within your company as a reference, in read-only form, for the sole purposes of debugging your products, maintaining your products, or enhancing interoperability” ([Open Source Stack Exchange][3])
* **“Your company”:** Defined as the company you worked for when you downloaded the software ([Open Source Stack Exchange][3])

## 3. Permissions

* **View source:** You may download and **view** the source code to understand implementation details (e.g., .NET BCL, ASP.NET, Windows Forms) ([Wikipedia][2])
* **Internal debugging/reference:** Use code solely as an internal reference tool during development and debugging ([Wikipedia][1])

## 4. Prohibitions

* **No distribution:** You may **not redistribute** the code—neither the original form nor any modifications—under any circumstances ([Wikipedia][1])
* **No modification:** You may **not modify** the code and deploy those changes outside your private copy ([Microsoft Wiki][4])
* **No derivative works:** Creating derivative works for release or sharing is expressly disallowed ([Wikipedia][1])

## 5. Typical Use Cases

* **Debugging assistance:** Developers debugging their own applications against Microsoft’s implementations
* **Educational/reference:** Engineers studying Microsoft’s coding patterns or frameworks for interoperability purposes ([Meta Stack Overflow][5])

## 6. Official License Text

> “This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use the software, you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not use the software.” ([referencesource.microsoft.com][6])

## 7. Comparison within SSI

| License    | Redistribution Allowed?        | Modification Allowed? | Copyleft Level       |                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Ms-PL**  | Yes                            | Yes                   | Permissive           |                  |
| **Ms-RL**  | Yes (with file-level copyleft) | Yes                   | Weak (reciprocal)    |                  |
| **Ms-RSL** | **No**                         | **No**                | **Most restrictive** | ([Wikipedia][1]) |

## 8. Criticisms & Considerations

* **Not open source:** Fails OSI criteria due to redistribution restrictions ([Wikipedia][1])
* **Legal risk for reuse:** Viewing code under MS-RSL does **not** grant any patent or redistribution rights—copying patterns too closely could raise IP concerns ([Meta Stack Overflow][5])
* **License proliferation:** Adds to the complexity of choosing compatible licenses in mixed-license environments ([GÉANT Wiki][7])

**Bottom line:** MS-RSL lets you **look** but not “touch” in any public or shared way. It’s suitable when you want to expose your code purely for reference/debugging without permitting any forks, derivatives, or redistribution.
